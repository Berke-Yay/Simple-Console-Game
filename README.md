# Simple-Console-Game
A simple console-log based game created by Java

Simply, there is a character class which assigns the various stats and methods of our main character which character can perform during the fight. 
There is also a monster class which defines the required qualities of a monster and gets them in a constructor.
Lastly, there is the arena class which defines the 3 different monster types and puts the user in action. In other words this is the page which controls in-fight situations in the game.
The gameplay is very simple, when faced a monster you can either get its information, try to escape or directly battle. Inside the battle, you can perform either a basic attack or use one of your three skills. After you perform an actioni the turn passes to the monster then it attacks you. For both your and monster's attacks there is a chance factor which controls the effectiveness of actions. An action can deal the damage it is supposed to give, or miss and doesn't do anyting, or can be critical and the affects can be doubled.

For all the details, just execute the codes attached to this repository.
